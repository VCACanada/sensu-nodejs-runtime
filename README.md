# sensu-nodejs-runtime

This project is based on [mjiderhamn/sensu-nodejs-runtime](https://github.com/mjiderhamn/sensu-nodejs-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file). It allows for [Sensu Go assets](https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/plugins/assets/) containing portable Node.js runtimes for various platforms.

This runtime asset should allow Node.js-based scripts to be packaged as separate assets containing Node.js scripts.

The version of the releases correspond to the Node.js version.
